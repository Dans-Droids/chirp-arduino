## Chirpino: Chirp for embedded devices

Libraries for Arduino and Spark Core devices to create and send chirps.

**ChirpinoSing for Arduinos** enables Arduino devices (and the UCL Engduino) to play chirp audio though connected earbuds or other simple speakers.

**ChirpinoLink for Arduinos** enables Arduinos with an ethernet shield to get online and interact with the Chirp API, to encapsulate and transmit larger data structures.

**Chirpino for Arduino Mega** is a full-featured command line example that uses both **ChirpinoSing** and **ChirpinoLink**. It lets you create, play and store lists of chirps, and schedule them to be played at chosen times or triggered by buttons or your own events.

**Chirpino for Spark Core** is the same program for the innately WiFi-connected Spark Core. It offers all the above, plus cloud commands. The Spark Core version is currently self-contained; you don't need any extra libraries.
