###Overview
ChirpinoSing is a library enabling Arduinos to output chirps as described at [chirp.io](chirp.io) through attached audio hardware. You'll need an Arduino Uno or an Arduino Mega 2560, a compatible speaker, earbud or other device to provide sound output, chirp codes from [Chirp](chirp.io) (test codes are provided in the examples), and a smartphone or tablet running the free Chirp app to listen out for the chirps emitted.

ChirpinoSing is fully described in the nearby ChirpinoSing.pdf file.
