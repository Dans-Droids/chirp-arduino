##Welcome to the Chirpino repository

Software for helping your small devices to chirp.

See **[Chirp.io](chirp.io)** 

Or our **[page for developers](chirp.io/hello-developers/)**

**ChirpinoSing for Arduinos** enables certain AVR-based Arduinos (and the UCL Engduino) to play chirps though connected earbuds or other simple speakers.

**ChirpinoLink for Arduinos** enables AVR-based Arduinos with an Ethernet Shield to get online and talk to the Chirp Server to create new chirps and query existing codes.

**Chirpino for Arduino Mega** is a full-featured command line or script-driven example and demonstration program using both of the above libraries. It lets you create, play and store lists of chirps, and schedule them to be played at chosen times or triggered by buttons or your own events.

**Chirpino for Spark Core** is the same program but for the naturally WiFi-connected Spark Core. It offers all the above plus cloud commands.
