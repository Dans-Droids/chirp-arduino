##Welcome to the Chirpino repository

The source of software for getting your small devices to chirp.

See **[Chirp.io](chirp.io)** 

Or our **[page for developers](chirp.io/hello-developers/)**

Our first release is the **ChirpinoSing** library for Arduinos; it enables Atmel-based Arduinos (and the UCL Engduino) to play chirps though connected earbuds or other simple speakers.

Much more coming very soon..
