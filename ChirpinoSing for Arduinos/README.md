## Chirp Audio for Arduino

*Version 1.1, January 2016*

## Overview

ChirpinoSing is a library enabling Arduino-based devices to output chirp audio via attached audio hardware. You'll need:

 * an Arduino Uno or an Arduino Mega 2560
 * a compatible speaker, earbud or other device to provide sound output
 * chirp shortcodes from [Chirp](http://chirp.io) (test shortcodes are provided in the examples)
 * an iOS or Android device running the Chirp SDK to receive the chirps transmitted

ChirpinoSing is fully described in the included [ChirpinoSing.pdf](ChirpinoSing.pdf).
